</span></span>You give many of these children the one-on-one attention they
need from an adult that they are currently lacking at home. You fill their need

they have had negative experiences with adults. You provide positive
interactions with adults that they need in order to be on a healthy
developmental track. </p>

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;
</span></span>When there is misbehavior or a difficult emotion, think to
yourself, “Where is this behavior stemming from?” </p>

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;

phrases like, “I understand…” or “I know you want…”</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;
</span></span>Examples: “The hammer is not for hitting the door.”; “I’m not for

style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;
</span></span>Suggest a more appropriate way of dealing with the situation, for
right now or for next time. This is saying things like, “If you don’t like
that, you can ask them to say ‘stop.’” Or “If you want your car back, you can
say, ‘please give it back.’”</p>

</span></span>If those steps do not solve the problem, a consequence may need
to be implemented. At this point, ask a House Parent for help, as they will
know what to do. Also let a House Parent know right away if you are not
comfortable addressing a behavior problem or if there is a serious behavior
problem.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On the rare occasion that the House Parents have to restrain a
child that is going to hurt themselves or others, your job is to keep the other
children calm, safe, and out of the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you see any kind of injury on a child when they come, be sure
to tell a House Parent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If a child gets hurt or has a medical emergency (seizure,
allergic reaction, choking, etc.) while they are here, tell a House Parent
right away so they can see to the child’s needs and document it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Parent’s or staff instructions.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity Training/Preventing Secondary Trauma</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Many of our children do not come from “traditional” families and
others may be in the nursery because they are currently experiencing something
traumatic. Avoid asking the children questions about their family. If they want
to share, that is great, but don’t probe or pry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Be sensitive to the various situations that these children may be
experiencing. Be careful how you address some things, for example, when a child
is being picked up, it is better to say, “Okay, it is time for you to leave,”
rather than, “Your mommy is here to pick you up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If a child tells you something about abuse that happened to them,
the most import thing is to REACT CALMLY. A reaction of shock or disgust will
reinforce their feelings of guilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LISTEN OPENLY to help them feel comfortable expressing what they
need to.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

emotionally processing something a child disclosed to you in the nursery, let
me or Rachelle know. We have therapists here that would be happy to talk to you
about something that happened in the nursery.</p>
